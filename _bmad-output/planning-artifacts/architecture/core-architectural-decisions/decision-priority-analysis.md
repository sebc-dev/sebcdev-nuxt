# Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**
- Content structure: By language with separate collections (`articles_fr`, `articles_en`)
- Frontmatter schema: English constants, auto-calculated readingTime
- Component architecture: Structured folders with custom Prose components
- SEO/GEO: Auto-generated llms.txt, Schema.org via @unhead

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**
- State management: Vue composables only (no Pinia)
- Image optimization: @nuxt/image + Cloudflare provider
- CI/CD: Cloudflare Pages direct Git integration

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**
- Newsletter integration
- Comments system
- Advanced analytics (heatmaps)
